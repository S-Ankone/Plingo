# Plingo
Hangedman Alternative Word Guessing Game https://s-ankone.github.io/Plingo/

Plingo is a 6-letter-word guessing game, limited to Dutch Words with a P (to reduce the scope of the assignment).
Some 'branding' indicates the game may evolve into 'Swingo', by adding more features to it. For now the
'working name' is Plingo though.

**As of patch-v2 the game is stable, playable and presentable; development is halted but might continue in the future.

*Unfortunately the basic jscript has been lost during development, but remnants can be found in the console.log
output (also a great place to look for non Dutch natives).
