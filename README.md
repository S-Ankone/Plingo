# Plingo
Hangedman Alternative Word Guessing Game https://s-ankone.github.io/Plingo/

Plingo is a 6-letter-word guessing game, limited to Dutch Words with a P (to reduce the scope of the assignment).
Some 'branding' indicates the game may evolve into 'Swingo', by adding more features to it. For now the
'working name' is Plingo though.

Unfortunately the basic jscript has been lost during development, but remnants can be found in the console.log
output (also a great place to look for non Dutch natives). 

*!* no longer any annoying pop-ups (prompt nor alert)... yay to patch.v1
